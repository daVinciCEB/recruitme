* Added a rough README, a .gitignore file set up for SublimeText, and a SublimeText project ([70cab55](https://gitlab.com/daVinciCEB/RecruitMe/commit/70cab55))
* Added quick license, will need to review this later with an actual lawyer ([dca4783](https://gitlab.com/daVinciCEB/RecruitMe/commit/dca4783))
