# RecruitMe - A rough synopsis to be expanded upon later

RecruitMe is planned on being an application that will allow job seekers and recruiters to connect in a more user friendly fashion.

A job seeker user will be able to set preferences on the types of jobs that they would like to see, including the distance from their current location, the experience necessary for a job, the type of company they would like to work for, and the experience that they currently have.

A recruiter will be able to set up various jobs for their company, and see the job seekers in the area that match the job description.
